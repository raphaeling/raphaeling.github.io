          I recently graduated Cum Laude from UCLA in Linguistics & Computer Science with minors in Digital
          Humanities and Cognitive Science. I’ve previously built software for an electric car company, an agricultural
          non-profit, and a league of streaming platforms. Right now, I’m focused on advancing my skills in front-end
          development while continuing to gain experience in the full stack.
          {/* As an undergraduate, I advocated for the needs of college
          students in tech at ACM at UCLA and hosted dev workshops and panels for high school students from underserved
          areas of Los Angeles at exploretech.la. */}
